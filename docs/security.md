# Security Policy

As a general rule, an issue is a security vulnerability if it could lead to:

- Loss of data
- Loss of privacy
- Censorship
- Any "ordinary" security problem, such as remote code execution
  or invalid memory access

In general, use your best judgement in determining whether an issue
is a security issue.
If not, go ahead and post it to the public issue tracker.

**If you believe you are aware of a security issue**, please contact Alpen Labs at
`security@alpenlabs.io`.
