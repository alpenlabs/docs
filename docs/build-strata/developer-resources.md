## Account Abstraction

- Creating an ERC-4337-compliant smart contract wallet
- Making transactions from a 4337-compliant smart contract wallet
- Building an app that leverages Strata's 4337 infrastructure
  - Pay gas for users

## RPC Endpoints

Document RPC endpoints available for:

- Syncing wallet balances and fetching blockchain data (RPC endpoint)

## Block Explorers

Links to the available block explorers.

## Development Tools

Short guides for getting set up to develop on Strata using popular frameworks:

- [Ape](https://apeworx.io/framework/)
- [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/)
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)

and libraries:

- [Ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/)

(donâ€™t need to cover all of them, but at least having one or two in each
category would be nice)

Note: If a wallet is needed for any examples, use [Frame](https://frame.sh/)
